# ssb-invite

"followbot" style invite codes for ssb.

this was the original design of follow messages.
a pub server creates a code, that allows a new peer to connect.
(the code is really a seed for a private key, that is only used once)
connecting via that code then makes the pub follow you.

soon, hopefully supercededed by [user-invites](https://github.com/ssbc/user-invites)
but supported for backwards compatibity
